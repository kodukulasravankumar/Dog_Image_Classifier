Answer: Yes, three models predicted correctly in my case for the image Dog_01.jpg which is German Shepherd.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified same breed in both the images Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg which is German Shepherd.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures identified correctly that image Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg are not dogs and also classified their what are.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:  First in this case we are lucky we got all three architectures the same answers but as there should be better ways so can consider another factor running time. As running vgg architecture is highest so it eliminated from our list. It very tough to choose from
Resnet architecture and alexnet architecture as both are same for this case (may be identified at the time large data processing as the example is very small) so this we can use both alexnet and resnet architectures.
